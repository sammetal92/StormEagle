Storm Eagle
===========

A simple 2D web-based platformer game made with the Phaser framework (http://www.phaser.io/).

The sprites and tileset has been taken from MegaMan X1. This game was made as a semester project for a university course. It only has one level as of yet, but all it was aimed to do was show some of the possibilities of Phaser.
